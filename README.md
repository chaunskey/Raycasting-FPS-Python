# Raycasting-FPS-Python
This project follows a Racyasting DOOM clone in Python using the instructions found in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECqUrT7IdqQ
I am attempting to follow the instructions to get a better understanding on OOP Principles used in such a large project.
I might also make some modifications and add functionality after completing the main project.
